# Development Log – Agentic Research Engineer

## Phase 1–2: Foundation
- Designed CLI-based tool using Python and Click
- Established clean project structure and packaging
- Focused on usability and extensibility

## Phase 3–4: Experiment Planning
- Implemented deterministic experiment planner
- Defined hypothesis, baselines, and metrics generation
- Ensured logic works without AI

## Phase 5–6: Output & Rendering
- Added markdown rendering using Jinja2 templates
- Implemented --output flag to save experiment plans
- Validated output format for research documentation

## Phase 7: AI Integration (Kiro)
- Used Kiro CLI to generate research hypotheses
- Discovered limitations of fully automating Kiro CLI calls
- Intentionally adopted human-in-the-loop AI workflow
- Ensured AI enhances ideation without breaking reliability

## Key Challenges
- Balancing automation with robustness
- Handling interactive AI tooling safely
- Designing AI usage that aligns with hackathon goals

## Final Outcome
A reliable research planning tool that demonstrates
practical, transparent, and responsible AI-assisted development.
